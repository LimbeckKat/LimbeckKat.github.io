### About
I'm a doctoral researcher at Helmholtz Munich and at TUM under the supervision of [Bastian Rieck](https://bastian.rieck.me/) and [Fabian Theis](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/theis-fabian). I am a member of [AIDOS Lab](https://aidos.group/) researching topological and geometric machine learning and [Theis Lab](https://github.com/theislab) researching machine learning in single cell genomics. My PhD is also part of the Munich School for Data Science ([MUDS](https://www.mu-ds.de/)) graduate school.

My main research goal is to use topological machine learning and geometric statistics to study complex structures in biological data. In particular, I am keen to develop robust computational methods to analyse single cell data across multiple scales of distances.
